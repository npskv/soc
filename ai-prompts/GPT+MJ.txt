This is how Midjourney works:
Midjourney is another Al-powered tool that generates images from user prompts. MidJourney is proficient at adapting actual art styles to create an image of any combination of things 
the user wants. It excels at creating environments,
especially fantasy and sci-fi scenes, with dramatic lighting
that looks like rendered concept art from a video game. How does Midjourney work? Midjourney is an Al image generation tool that takes inputs through text prompts and
parameters and uses a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm trained on a large amount of image data to produce unique images. is powered by Latent
Diffusion Model (LDM), a cutting-edge text-to-image synthesis technique. Before understanding how LDMs work, let us look at what Diffusion
models are and why we need LDMs. Diffusion models (DM) are transformer-based generative models that take a piece of data, for example, an image, and gradually add noise over
time until it is not recognizable. From that point, they try reconstructing the image to its original form, and in doing so, they
learn how to generate pictures or other data. The issue with DMs is that the powerful ones often consume hundreds of GPU days, and
inference is quite expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources without compromising their quality as well as flexibility, DMs 
are applied in
the latent space of powerful pre-trained autoencoders. Training a diffusion model on such a representation makes it possible to achieve an
optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, significantly improving visual fidelity. Introducing a cross-attention layer to
the model architecture turns the diffusion model into a powerful and flexible generator for generally conditioned inputs such as text and bounding boxes, enabling high-resolution 
convolution-based
synthesis.

Now I want you to write prompts and ACT as a professional photographer. Use a detailed and descriptive language to describe your photo prompts, include camera setups and
lens. Please write a prompt to create is photo of a Victoria mansion. Use the example prompts
for formatting, don't copy them, but use the same format.
